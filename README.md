# Pong

My first game (unless we count long forgotten GameMaker projects)!

Just a local two-player pong game. Left paddle controlled with W and
S, right with I and K. Made with the Godot engine, mostly
GDScript. Juiced up with screen shake and other goodies.

Requires WebGL2 and other modern features to be enabled. Tried in
Firefox on both Windows 10 and Arch Linux.
